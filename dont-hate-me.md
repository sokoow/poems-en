# Don't hate me

Maybe I was born different,  
Other than you,  
It doesn't mean you should be fearful,  
Cause I'm a human too.  

Don't hate me cause I'm not like you,  
Don't look like I do owe you,  
We are made of the same feelings,  
Same blood, same core values.  

So no matter what color,  
Religion or race,  
What continent,  
We all just need peace.  

It may not be easy,  
And straightforward at first.  
But one day we will all unite,  
And beat differences and divides with our fists.  

Cause planet still goes that single same direction,  
It's too late to divide and stir up oppositions,  
We all have the same plan too,  
And the plan is called 'just be and stay good'.  

So next time you see your sister or brother,  
In a need, be like all the others, and help,  
Even change small little detail for the other,   
Allow for their troubles to break.

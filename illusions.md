# Illusions

When you see around illusions,  
And your truths are just confusion,  
And the problems are too many,  
So the choice becomes binary.  

Maybe you will also feel,  
Cracked and broken, very ill,  
But fear not my little brother,  
There are also many others.  

These are all just your illusions,  
So you need a fast conclusion.  
Turn on your creative thinking,  
And solutions will come quickly.  

And remember this my hero,  
That you are just not a zero,  
Or not even you are one,  
You’re just very precious human.  
Also a choice millionaire,  
Unlimited, big like a bear.  

And all sudden situations,  
You will pass like a true champion.  

Just don’t get easily provoked,  
To fix all that there is broken,  
I know you like all at once,  
But give your patience a chance.  

Don’t just blow up into fight,  
Send some conflicts into void.  
Cause the most important lesson,  
Is to have inside progression.  

When you reach internal zen,  
Only, and the only then.  
Wake up brother, start to listen,  
Don’t put on your soul a meter.

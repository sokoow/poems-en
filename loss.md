# Loss

You won't even know of that my feeling,  
That is when you're now left alone.  
For so many years of common being,  
Only our memories won't be gone.  

And I will now roam across the globe,  
But won't be showing it to you more.  
Awoken single every bright morning,  
Can't have a soul to talk to anymore.  

And I will carry all that pain,  
And anger, till it is contained.  
Cause every part around me,  
Of you only reminds blindly.  

I won't delete our thousands of pictures,  
Or try to erase our memories from the mind.  
Will not give up any life lessons,  
That we passed together till now.  

And after feeling all that much,  
Also couple of sober too moments,  
I think my life sense have might,  
I surely will get out of this stronger.  

Quite frankly I'm just very grateful,  
For all that you've done for me,  
You saved me thousands lives, was eventful,  
And were improving my days at ease.  

Today I know that you can't just like that,  
Love somebody and this be one sided,  
You can't just jail and just say 'stay',  
By words and actions cannot get blinded.  

So true love is I think,  
To let the other one leave sometimes.  
Believe me this isn't even a sin,  
But trust that other will behave just fine.  

Some things just can't be measured,  
They can't be entirely even written,  
Exposure to them uncovers treasures,  
That inside you might have been omitted.  

And I hear all things wrongly today,  
And it shouts bad words on me.  
But we will meet each other again,  
With my small crazy teddy.  

Also, till the end of days,  
I will carry this all inside me,  
So in doubt it reminds me then,  
And from fall helps me bounce back promptly.  

Till my last chance in eternity,  
When I stop fighting my memories.  
Will put some more effort again,  
For my balance to be regained.  

I remember all the things now,  
And stay sober till rest of life.  
Cause I still carry that your say:  
'Love just makes you brave!'

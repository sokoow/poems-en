# Mechanized

Mechanic thoughts,  
Mechanic sex,  
Mechanic actions,  
Mechanic deaths.  

It's all around you,  
Don't pretend not to see,  
But this doesn't have  
To happen to you and me.  

When you sit at your computer,  
Think a bit about our future.  
Have your ethical rules,  
So your projects will stay cool.  

And will serve humanity,  
Don't let them be weaponized,  
Otherwise we'll all be doomed,  
And strange will become our homes.  

Pay attention to that moment,  
When machines try taking you over.  
Then just stand up and relax,  
Be a human, bring the craic back.  

Life is not computer game,  
Or a really good meme,  
Life is here only for humans,  
Deep feelings, and good humour.
